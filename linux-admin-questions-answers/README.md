What is ICMP protocol? Why do you need to use?
```
ICMP is a protocol for sending various messages to report network conditions.
ICMP is used by a device, like a router, to communicate with the source of a data packet about transmission issues. For example, if a datagram is not delivered, ICMP might report this back to the host with details to help discern where the transmission went wrong. It's a protocol that believes in direct communication in the workplace.
Ping is a utility which uses ICMP messages to report back information on network connectivity and the speed of data relay between a host and a destination computer. It's one of the few instances where a user can interact directly with ICMP, which typically only functions to allow networked computers to communicate with one another automatically.
